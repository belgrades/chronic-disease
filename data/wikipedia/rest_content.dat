million people globally world workforce without job causes unemployment heavily debated classical economics new classical economics austrian school economics argued market mechanisms reliable means resolving unemployment theories argue interventions imposed labor market outside unionization bureaucratic work rules minimum wage laws taxes regulations claim discourage hiring workers keynesian economics emphasizes cyclical nature unemployment recommends government interventions economy claims reduce unemployment recessions theory focuses recurrent shocks suddenly reduce aggregate demand goods services thus reduce demand workers keynesian models recommend government interventions designed increase demand workers include financial stimuli publicly funded job creation expansionist monetary policies namesake economist john maynard keynes believed root cause unemployment desire investors receive money rather produce products possible without public bodies producing new money third group theories emphasize need stable supply capital investment maintain full employment view government guarantee full employment fiscal policy monetary policy trade policy stated example us

unemployment frictional unemployment structural unemployment classical unemployment additional types unemployment occasionally mentioned seasonal unemployment hardcore unemployment hidden unemployment though several definitions voluntary involuntary unemployment economics literature simple distinction often applied voluntary unemployment attributed individual decisions whereas involuntary unemployment exists socio economic environment including market structure government intervention level aggregate demand individuals operate terms much frictional unemployment voluntary since reflects

draw clearest cases involuntary unemployment fewer job vacancies unemployed workers even wages allowed adjust even vacancies filled unemployed workers would still remain happens cyclical unemployment macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment boomerang back exacerbate macroeconomic forces classical real wage unemployment occurs real wages job set market clearing level causing number job seekers exceed number vacancies hand economists argue wages fall livable wage many choose drop labor market longer seek employment especially true countries low income families supported public welfare systems cases wages would high enough motivate people choose employment receive public welfare wages livable wage likely result lower labor market participation stated scenario addition must noted consumption goods services primary driver increased need labor higher wages leads workers income available consume goods services therefore higher wages increase general consumption result need labor increases unemployment decreases economy many economists argued unemployment increases increased governmental regulation example minimum wage laws raise cost low skill laborers market equilibrium resulting increased unemployment people wish work going rate cannot new higher enforced wage greater value labour laws restricting layoffs may make businesses less likely hire first place hiring becomes risky however argument overly simplifies relationship wage rates unemployment ignoring numerous factors contribute unemployment murray rothbard suggest even social taboos prevent wages

validates classical unemployment theory data shows strong correlation adjusted real wage unemployment united states however maintain data take account exogenous events cyclical deficient demand keynesian unemployment occurs enough aggregate demand economy provide jobs everyone wants work demand goods services falls less production needed consequently fewer workers needed wages sticky fall

workers exceeds number job vacancies even full employment attained open jobs filled workers would still remain unemployed associate cyclical unemployment frictional unemployment factors cause friction

people prefer injections less expensive pumps require wearing continually attached device however clinical literature clear patients whose basal insulin requirements tend vary throughout day require
