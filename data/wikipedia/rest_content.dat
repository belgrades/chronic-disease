resolving unemployment theories argue interventions imposed labor market outside unionization bureaucratic work rules minimum wage laws taxes regulations claim discourage hiring workers keynesian economics emphasizes cyclical nature unemployment recommends government interventions economy claims reduce unemployment recessions theory focuses recurrent shocks suddenly reduce aggregate demand goods services thus reduce demand workers keynesian models recommend government interventions designed increase demand workers include financial stimuli publicly funded job creation expansionist monetary policies namesake economist john maynard keynes believed root cause unemployment desire investors receive money rather produce products possible without public bodies producing new money

macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment boomerang back exacerbate macroeconomic forces classical real wage unemployment occurs real wages job set market clearing level causing number job seekers exceed number vacancies hand economists argue wages fall livable wage many choose drop labor market longer seek employment especially true countries low income families supported public welfare systems cases wages would high enough motivate people choose employment receive public welfare wages livable wage likely result lower labor market participation stated scenario addition must noted consumption goods services primary driver increased need labor higher wages leads workers income available consume goods services therefore higher wages increase general consumption result need labor increases unemployment decreases economy many economists argued unemployment increases increased governmental regulation example minimum wage laws raise cost low skill laborers market

people prefer injections less expensive pumps require wearing continually attached device however clinical literature clear patients whose basal insulin requirements tend vary throughout day require
