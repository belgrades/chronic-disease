    "# Predicting the prevalence of Diabetes using Google Trends online data.\n",

    "The main goal of this assignment is to set up a machine learning framework that predicts the prevalence of a specific chronic disease (diabetes) from digital records of online behavior (Google Trends).\n",

    "## Brief explanation of the disease\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [The Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/index.html) diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that affects how your body turns food into energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of diabetes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type 1:** Results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin.\n",
    "1. **Type 2:** Begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly.\n",
    "1. **Gestational diabetes:** Occurs when pregnant women without a previous history of diabetes develop high blood sugar levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "More than 100 million Americans are living with diabetes (30.3 million) or prediabetes (84.1 million).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why diabetes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple articles such as [Sugar, real heart disease killer](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2574269/Sugar-not-fat-real-heart-disease-killer-We-got-wrong-diet-advice-claims-expert.html), [The Sugar Conspiracy](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin) and [is fat killing you... or is sugar?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/is-fat-killing-you-or-is-sugar) exploit the issue of sugar consumption in modern society. Despite what normal assuptiom tell us, it seems that the major influence of what are so called \"the XXI century diseases\" is sugar. Giving the major importance of this topic seems clear that if we focus our analysis into a sugar-related disease as diabetes we would have, at least, a lot of results in the online part of our investigation.\n",

    "### Brief explanation of past works\n",
    "\n",
    "In works [1] and [4] the focus of both projects is to detect influenza epidemics using search query data (using either Google or Baidu). In the case of [1] the importance of the report, according to the authors, is because the early detection of influenza activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. As a result, they say that a way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines. Furthermore, in [4] they make special emphasis in the type of data they need in order to have successful results: \"The search query data for each keyword should be represented as a sequential time series with a daily, weekly or monthly resolution\". Finally, they state that studies using web search query data have achieved good results in empirical practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works [2] and [3] are used in work [4] to build the regression model they call **Composite Search Index** and is more or less replicated in the present work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible limitations of our work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(Sample Size):** Unfortunately, we will use data that is temporally aggregated in the **yearly** scale because the data we want to predict found in [the database of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/index.html) and therefore we will analyze from 2004 to 2016, meaning that we have 13 data points at most.\n",
    "1. **(Epidemic vs Chronic disease):** One of the major reasons behind the usage of search query data predicting works [1] and [4] is because of the fact that influenza is an **epidemic** type of disease. This means that it can be transmitted. The normal reaction of people is to understand either symptoms, treatment, diagnosis, among others looking for information on internet. We could say that this behaviour should be the same for any other type of diseases. However, is not true as the engagement of people using the platform is directly proportional to the impact of the disease in a given time. Therefore, is easier to see the influence of an epidemic disease as the number of sick people increases rapidly given an epidemic of it. Conversely, later on we will see how the prevalence of diabetes increases over time with a predictable pattern either in Google Trend data or in the so called ground truth data.\n",
    "1. **(Google Trend data):** In projects [1] and [4] they use **absolute** values of queries (or sampling estimates) to calculate the correlation between the real value (influenza) and the this values. In our case, the Google Trend data represents a normalized estimate from 0 to 100 ( This values can reach 100 in some years of our data) that represents the \"importance\" of the query term in a given period of time. Therefore, we don't have the real value but an estimated of importance that Google doesn't explain in detail. \n",
