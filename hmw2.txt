DIGITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
ASSIGNMENT #2
DUE DATE: 
JANUARY 22th, 2018
HARD DEADLINE: JANUARY 12th, 2018
========================================================



The goal of this assignment is to set up a machine learning framework that predicts the prevalence of a specific 
chronic disease or health risk factor from digital records of online behavior.

You will need:



1) GROUND TRUTH DATA


For this assignment you will use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS, https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/) database of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The Web interface to find and download specific datasets is available at: 
https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/index.html


Data is spatially aggregated at different levels (US, state, county, etc.) and temporally aggregated at the yearly scale.

Select "Chronic Health Indicators" and then select a chronic condition of your choice  e.g., asthma)and download 
the corr
esponding data in CSV (click on the gear icon)
for the available years and different indicators 
(e.g., raw prevalence, age-adjusted prevalence, etc.)



2) DIGITAL PROXY DATA
You will use Google Trends data available at 
https://trends.google.com
Select the relevant keyword(s) for your prediction problem,
and select "United States" 
(or go directly to https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US).
Scroll down to "subregion" 
(the default spatial regions are US states, matching the ground truth spatial aggregation) and download your data in 
CSV format.
Make sure that you collect data for the same time intervals for which you have ground truth data

(choose "custom time range" and then "full year" to select for a specific year).

Keep in mind that the same lexical term might refer to multiple meaning of entities in the Google Trends interface 
(e.g., "asthma" as a search engine query, "occupational asthma" in the news, "Asthma" the movie, etc.)

PART 1: CORRELATION STUDY

 

1.1 - Study the correlation between the ground truth data and the Google Trends data. Explore multiple features of the 
ground truth data (e.g., crude prevalence, age-adjusted prevalence, etc.), and multiple keywords or entity types for 
querying the Google Trends data. Check for stability (or lack there of) across different years.

 
1.2 - Download US state-level data on income and poverty from the US Census Bureau. The data is available at: 
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/income-poverty/p60-259.html
 Study the correlation of your target 
ground truth feature with income/poverty features.


* 

PART 2: PREDICTION MODEL

 

2.1 - Set up a regression model that predicts your chosen ground truth indicator(s) on the basis of  Google Trends 
data for several keywords. Discuss the strategy you use for selecting additional keywords and for selecting which ones 
you include in the model. Select the model via temporal and spatial cross-validation, and discuss its generalizability 
across states and years on the basis of your results.

 
2.2 - Add to your model census features at the US state level (e.g., income data) and discuss how adding them impacts 
the predictive performance of the model.

 
2.3 - Look for data on health insurance coverage across US states (any source you can find) and integrate it in your model.
Repeat the above evaluation.

NOTICE:


* BONUS points:

	
- nicely commented code with accurately discussed results (3 points)

	
- timely completion of the assignment by due date of January 5th (2 points)


NOTES:
  
- This assignment should be carried out by a pair of students, who will receive the same score upon evaluation.
	
It is possible to carry out the assignment as an individual assignment, 
if so desired, but there is no bonus for doing so.

	
- the assignment must be delivered as a self-contained Jupyter Python (2 or 3) notebook, 
together with the data files it depends on for execution. 
The notebook should run without errors and produce all of the requested outputs.

	
- the notebook should be delivered via email or deposited in the Dropbox folder for the course 
(in both cases, together with the data files it needs to run)
